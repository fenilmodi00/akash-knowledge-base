Akash Providers play a pivotal role in the Akash Network by utilizing the [Akash Provider software](https://github.com/akash-network/provider), enabling them to effectively manage resources, submit bids, and interact with users. This section discusses the key components and responsibilities of Akash Providers.

### Key Components

1. **[Provider Daemon (`akashd`)][akashd]**: The Provider Daemon is a crucial software component responsible for managing the provider's resources. It communicates with the Akash blockchain, handles resource allocation for deployments, and processes deployment orders. This includes receiving and processing deployment orders, submitting bids, and orchestrating the deployment of user applications.

2. [**Container Orchestration**][kubernetes]: Akash Providers leverage container orchestration systems like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm. These systems efficiently manage the deployment and scaling of user applications, ensuring optimal resource allocation and the secure execution of applications within the provider's infrastructure.

### Responsibilities

#### Resource Management

Akash Providers bear the responsibility of managing their computing resources, encompassing CPU, memory, storage, and bandwidth. Efficient and secure allocation of resources to user applications is crucial, requiring vigilant monitoring of infrastructure health and performance.

#### Bidding on Orders

Upon the generation of deployment orders broadcast to the network, Akash Providers analyze and place competitive bids. Balancing bids is essential for maximizing utilization and revenue while remaining competitive in the marketplace.

#### Lease Management

After a user selects a winning bid, Akash Providers must manage the resulting lease. This involves allocating resources according to lease terms, ensuring secure and efficient deployment and operation of user applications.

#### Deployment Management

Providers are tasked with deploying and managing user applications within their infrastructure. This includes overseeing the application's lifecycle, such as starting, stopping, and scaling, while maintaining security and isolation from other deployments.

#### Monitoring and Reporting

Akash Providers are obligated to monitor their infrastructure and user applications, guaranteeing optimal and secure operation. Reporting metrics and events to users and the Akash Network, such as resource utilization, deployment status, and billing information, is an integral part of their role.

In summary, Akash Providers are indispensable contributors to the Akash Network, providing computing resources and managing user application deployments. Their interaction with the Akash blockchain through the [Provider Daemon (`akashd`)][akashd] and utilization of container orchestration systems ensures the secure and efficient deployment of applications. Managing resources, bidding on orders, handling leases, and proactive infrastructure monitoring are vital tasks for maintaining competitiveness in the marketplace.
