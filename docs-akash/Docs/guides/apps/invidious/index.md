Deploying [Invidious](https://invidious.io/), a privacy-respecting front-end for YouTube, on the Akash Network allows you to leverage decentralized cloud computing resources. This guide will walk you through the process of deploying Invidious on Akash using both the [Akash CLI](https://akash.network/docs/deployments/akash-cli/installation/) and [Akash Console](https://akash.network/docs/deployments/akash-console/).

## Prerequisites

1. **Akash Account**: Set up your Akash account and ensure you have AKT (Akash tokens) to pay for deployment.

2. **Docker**: Install Docker on your local machine to manage the Invidious container.

3. **Invidious Docker Image**: Familiarize yourself with the Invidious Docker image (`invidious/invidious:latest`).

4. **PostgreSQL Database**: Invidious requires a PostgreSQL database. Ensure you have access to a running instance.

5. **Domain Name (Optional)**: For a professional setup, configure a custom domain.

## Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

### Prepare the Invidious Docker Image

The official Docker image for Invidious is available on Docker Hub. Pull the image and test it locally if necessary:

```

docker pull invidious/invidious:latest

```

Optionally, run it locally to ensure it works as expected:

```

docker run -p 3000:3000 invidious/invidious

```

### Set Up Akash CLI or Use the Console

You can deploy on Akash using either the CLI or the web-based console:

- **[Akash CLI Installation Guide](https://akash.network/docs/deployments/akash-console/)**: Follow this guide to install the Akash CLI, which is essential for advanced deployment management.

- **[Akash Console Guide](https://akash.network/docs/deployments/akash-console/)**: Use the Akash Console for a more user-friendly, graphical approach to deploying on Akash.

## Create the Deployment File

Below is the SDL (Service Definition Language) file tailored for deploying Invidious on Akash. This file defines the resources and configuration needed for the deployment.

```

deployment:
  invidious:
    akash:
      profile: invidious
      count: 1
```

### Deploy Invidious on Akash

#### Using Akash CLI:

1. Prepare the SDL file: Save the above SDL configuration as `deployment.yaml`.

2. Deploy via CLI:

    - Navigate to the directory containing `deployment.yaml`.

    - Run the following command to initiate deployment:

    - Create your Certificate

Akash requires an account to have a valid certificate associated with it to start participating in the deployment process. In this section of the guide, we will create a certificate locally, and then proceed to store this certificate on the Akash blockchain. To do this, ensure you have followed all the steps outlined in this guide up to this point. Additionally, these transactions must be executed from an Akash account in possession of some $AKT tokens.

Once an account has a certificate associated with it, it can begin deploying services on the Akash blockchain. **A certificate needs to be created only once per account. After creation, it can be used across any number of deployments for as long as it remains valid.**


```
provider-services tx cert generate client -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Publish Cert to the Blockchain

```
provider-services tx cert publish client -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Create your Deployment

- CPU Support

Only x86_64 processors are officially supported for Akash deployments. This may change in the future and when ARM processors are supported it will be announced and documented.

- Akash Deployment

> _**NOTE**_ - if your current terminal session has been used to create prior deployments, issue the command `unset AKASH_DSEQ` to prevent receipt of error message `Deployment Exists`

To deploy on Akash, run:

```
provider-services tx deployment create deploy.yaml -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Find your Deployment \-

Find the Deployment Sequence (DSEQ) in the deployment you just created. You will need to replace the AKASH_DSEQ with the number from your deployment to configure a shell variable.

```bash
export AKASH_DSEQ=CHANGETHIS
```

Now set the Order Sequence (OSEQ) and Group Sequence (GSEQ). Note that if this is your first time deploying on Akash, OSEQ and GSEQ will be 1.

```bash
AKASH_OSEQ=1
AKASH_GSEQ=1
```

Verify we have the right values populated by running:

```bash
echo $AKASH_DSEQ $AKASH_OSEQ $AKASH_GSEQ
```

- View your Bids

After a short time, you should see bids from providers for this deployment with the following command:

```bash
provider-services query market bid list -owner=$AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS -node $AKASH_NODE -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -state=open
```

- Choose a Provider

Note that there are bids from multiple different providers. In this case, both providers happen to be willing to accept a price of _1 uAKT_. This means that the lease can be created using _1 uAKT_ or _0.000001 AKT_ per block to execute the container. You should see a response similar to:

```
bids:
- bid:
    bid_id:
      dseq: "140324"
      gseq: 1
      oseq: 1

      provider: akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    created_at: "140326"
    price:
      amount: "1"
      denom: uakt
    state: open
  escrow_account:
    balance:
      amount: "50000000"
      denom: uakt
    id:
      scope: bid
      xid: akash1vn06ycjjnvsvl639fet9lajjctuturrtx7fvuj/140324/1/1/akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    owner: akash1f6gmtjpx4r8qda9nxjwq26fp5mcjyqmaq5m6j7
    settled_at: "140326"
    state: open
    transferred:
      amount: "0"
      denom: uakt
```

For this example, we will choose `akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal` Run this command to set the provider shell variable:

```
AKASH_PROVIDER=akash10cl5rm0cqnpj45knzakpa4cnvn5amzwp4lhcal
```

Verify we have the right value populated by running:

```
echo $AKASH_PROVIDER
```

- Create a Lease

Create a lease for the bid from the chosen provider above by running this command:

```
provider-services tx market lease create -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Confirm the Lease

You can check the status of your lease by running:

```
provider-services query market lease list -owner $AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS -node $AKASH_NODE -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ
```

Note the bids will close automatically after 5 minutes, and you may get the response:

```
bid not open
```

If this happens, close your deployment and open a new deployment again. To close your deployment run this command:

```
provider-services tx deployment close -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ  -owner $AKASH_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

If your lease was successful you should see a response that ends with:

```
    state: active
```

{/* {% hint style="info" %} */}
Please note that once the lease is created, the provider will begin debiting your deployment's escrow account, even if you have not completed the deployment process by uploading the manifest in the following step.
{/* {% endhint %} */}

- Send the Manifest

Upload the manifest using the values from above step:

```
provider-services send-manifest deploy.yaml -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Confirm the URL

Now that the manifest is uploaded, your image is deployed. You can retrieve the access details by running the below:

```
provider-services lease-status -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER
```

You should see a response similar to:

```javascript
{
  "services": {
    "web": {
      "name": "web",
      "available": 1,
      "total": 1,
      "uris": [
        "rga3h05jetf9h3p6dbk62m19ck.ingress.ewr1p0.mainnet.akashian.io"
      ],
      "observed_generation": 1,
      "replicas": 1,
      "updated_replicas": 1,
      "ready_replicas": 1,
      "available_replicas": 1
    }
  },
  "forwarded_ports": {}
}
```

You can access the application by visiting the hostnames mapped to your deployment. Look for a URL/URI and copy it to your web browser.

- View your logs

You can view your application logs to debug issues or watch progress like so:

```bash
provider-services lease-logs \
  -dseq "$AKASH_DSEQ" \
  -provider "$AKASH_PROVIDER" \
  -from "$AKASH_KEY_NAME"
```

- Update the Deployment

- Update the Manifest

Update the deploy.yaml manifest file with the desired change.

_**NOTE:**_\*\* Not all attributes of the manifest file are eligible for deployment update. If the hardware specs of the manifest are updated (I.e. CPU count), a re-deployment of the workload is necessary. Other attributes, such as deployment image and funding, are eligible for updates.

- Issue Transaction for On Chain Update

```
provider-services tx deployment update deploy.yaml -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```

- Send Updated Manifest to Provider

```
provider-services send-manifest deploy.yaml -dseq $AKASH_DSEQ -provider $AKASH_PROVIDER -from $AKASH_KEY_NAME
```


3. Using Akash Console:

    - **Log into Akash Console**: Open the [Akash Console](console.akash.network) and connect to it using your wallet.

    - **Upload SDL File**: Use the console interface to upload the `deployment.yaml` file.

    - **Deploy**: Follow the on-screen instructions to deploy the service.

### Access Your Invidious Instance

1. **Obtain the External IP**: Once the deployment is successful, Akash will provide an external IP address.

2. **Configure Domain Name (Optional)**: If you have a domain name, set up DNS to point to the provided IP address.

3. **Access the Service**: Open your browser and visit the IP address (or domain name) to access Invidious.

### Secure the Deployment

1. **HTTPS Configuration**: Use [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) (or a SSL/TLS certificate service) to secure your deployment with SSL.

2. **Firewall and Security**: Ensure proper security configurations are in place to protect your deployment.
