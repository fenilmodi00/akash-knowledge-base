To deploy Elasticsearch on the Akash Network, you’ll typically go through these steps:

## 1. Prepare the Akash SDL File

An Akash SDL file (in YAML) defines the resources and configuration needed for the deployment. Below is a sample configuration to deploy Elasticsearch.

```
---
version: "2.0"

services:
  elasticsearch:
    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.15.5  # Replace with the desired version
    expose:
      - port: 9200
        to:
          - global: true
    env:
      - discovery.type=single-node  # Configure for a single-node deployment
      - ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m  # Adjust memory limits as needed

profiles:
  compute:
    elasticsearch:
      resources:
        cpu:
          units: 1
        memory:
          size: 1Gi
        storage:
          size: 5Gi  # Adjust as needed

  placement:
    westcoast:
      attributes:
        region: us-west
      pricing:
        elasticsearch:
          denom: uakt
          amount: 500

deployment:
  elasticsearch:
    westcoast:
      profile: elasticsearch
      count: 1
```

2. Deploy Using Akash CLI

Make sure you have the Akash CLI installed and configured.

    1. **Initialize the deployment**:

    
    ```
    provider-services tx deployment create <your_sdl_file>.yml --from <your_wallet> --chain-id <chain_id> --node <node_url>
    ```

    2. **Wait for bid completion and accept the lease**: You’ll need to monitor for a bid and accept the lease using Akash CLI commands.

    3. **Access Elasticsearch**: Once deployed, you should be able to access your Elasticsearch instance via the external IP and the specified port (9200 in this case).

3. Testing Elasticsearch

After deployment, verify that Elasticsearch is accessible by sending an HTTP request to the endpoint:

```

curl -X GET "http://<deployment_IP>:9200/"
```

This SDL file provides a basic single-node Elasticsearch setup. For production, you might want a multi-node setup, secure configurations, and perhaps additional monitoring services.
