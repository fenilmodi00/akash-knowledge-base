Akash Network is a decentralized cloud computing platform that offers cost-effective and flexible solutions for deploying various applications, including game servers. Deploying a Minecraft server on Akash lets you enjoy the benefits of decentralization, reduced hosting costs, and high availability.

In this guide, we will walk you through deploying a Minecraft server on Akash using an example SDL (Service Definition Language) template. We'll also explain key configurations to customize the Minecraft experience.

## **Why Use Akash for a Minecraft Server?**

1. **Decentralization:** Host your server on a blockchain-powered cloud to reduce reliance on traditional hosting providers.
2. **Cost-Effective:** Akash's decentralized nature allows users to leverage competitive pricing from providers.
3. **Flexibility:** The Akash platform is compatible with a wide range of applications, including custom game servers.
4. **Performance:** Akash supports hosting on high-performance compute resources, ensuring low latency and reliability for gaming.

## **Prerequisites**

Before deploying your Minecraft server, ensure you have the following:

1. **Akash Wallet:** To interact with the Akash blockchain.
2. **AKT Tokens:** Used for bidding and payment for compute resources.
3. **Akash CLI or Console Access:** To deploy and manage workloads.
4. **Basic SDL Template:** A file that defines the deployment configuration.
5. **Dockerized Minecraft Server Image:** For example, [itzg's Minecraft Server Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server).

## **Steps to Deploy Minecraft Server on Akash**

### **1. Prepare the SDL File**
The SDL (Service Definition Language) file specifies the deployment details such as compute resources, ports, and Docker image. Below is a sample SDL template for deploying a Minecraft server:

```yaml
version: "2.0"
services:
  minecraft:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server:latest
    env:
      EULA: "TRUE"                 # Agree to the Minecraft EULA
      VERSION: "1.20.1"            # Specify the Minecraft server version
      MEMORY: "2G"                 # Allocate memory to the server
    expose:
      - port: 25565
        as: 25565
        to:
          - global: true
profiles:
  compute:
    minecraft:
      resources:
        cpu:
          units: 1                 # 1 CPU core
        memory:
          size: 2Gi                # 2GB RAM
        storage:
          size: 10Gi               # 10GB storage
  placement:
    westcoast:
      attributes:
        region: us-west
      pricing:
        minecraft:                 # Define pricing for the service
          denom: uakt
          amount: 100              # Set a bid price
deployment:
  minecraft:
    westcoast:
      profile: minecraft
      count: 1                     # Deploy a single instance
```

### **2. Customize the SDL**
Modify the SDL to fit your requirements:
- **Version:** Adjust `VERSION` to the desired Minecraft server version.
- **Memory:** Increase or decrease the `MEMORY` allocation based on expected player load.
- **Storage:** Ensure enough storage is available for world data and plugins.
- **Pricing:** Set a competitive bid price under `amount` to secure compute resources.

---

### **3. Deploy the SDL**
Use the Akash CLI to deploy your server.

1. **Create the Deployment:**
   ```bash
   provider-services tx deployment create <path-to-sdl> --from <your-wallet> --chain-id <chain-id>
   ```

2. **Bid for Resources:**
   Wait for providers to respond with bids. Accept a bid using the CLI:
   ```bash
   provider-services tx market lease create --dseq <deployment-sequence> --from <your-wallet> --chain-id <chain-id>
   ```

3. **Monitor the Deployment:**
   Use the following command to check the status of your deployment:
   ```bash
   provider-services query market lease list --owner <your-wallet>
   ```

---

### **4. Connect to the Minecraft Server**
Once the deployment is active:
- Obtain the external IP address of your Akash deployment.
- Use the Minecraft client to connect to the server by entering the IP address and port `25565`.

---

### **5. Manage and Update the Server**
To manage or update your Minecraft server:
- Modify the SDL file with new configurations.
- Redeploy the updated SDL using the Akash CLI.
- Use the Akash logs to monitor server activity:
  ```bash
  provider-services logs --dseq <deployment-sequence> --from <your-wallet>
  ```

---

## **Tips for Customization**
- **Add Plugins:** Mount a volume for persistent storage and include plugin files in the Docker container.
- **Backup Worlds:** Schedule backups by adding scripts to the Minecraft container or utilizing Akash's storage options.
- **Enable Mods:** Use a Forge or Fabric Minecraft server image for modding support.

## **Conclusion**
With Akash, you can deploy a Minecraft server that benefits from decentralized infrastructure and cost efficiency. By following this guide and customizing the provided SDL template, you can create a Minecraft server tailored to your gaming needs. Enjoy hosting your Minecraft world in a decentralized, scalable environment!
